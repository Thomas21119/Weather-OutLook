This is a weather outlook app in which you can search for Weather by city and pressing the submit button. The website will then show you the city you are most likely asking for, the current date as well as its current weather conditions and conditions over the next five days. Upon searching for a valid city the search is saved to local storage and displayed on the left hand side of the screen as a button for quicker access to cities youve visited in the past
